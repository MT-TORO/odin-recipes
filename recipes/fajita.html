        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Make some <strong>delicious</strong> beef fajitas with the following recipe. This will be the envy of any man that has attempted to grill a piece of meat. This formula was inspired by Montezuma himself and passed down through many generations only to be lost in the battle of el Alamo. After many attempts at recreating, I <strong>FINALLY</strong> perfected the recipe. The Aztec gods would be proud. Enjoy!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 lb of outside skirt steak</li>
            <li>1 bundle of cilantro</li>
        </ul>
