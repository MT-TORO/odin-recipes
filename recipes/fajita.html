        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Make some <strong>DELICIOUS</strong> beef fajitas with the following recipe. This will be the envy of any man that has attempted to grill a piece of meat. This formula was inspired by Montezuma himself and passed down through many generations only to be lost in the battle of el Alamo. After many attempts at recreating, I <strong>FINALLY</strong> perfected the recipe. The Aztec gods would be proud. Enjoy!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 lb of outside skirt steak</li>
            <li>1 bundle of cilantro</li>
            <li>4 cups of olive oil</li>
            <li>4 TBSP of El Rancho Red Fajita Seasoning <a href="https://shop.elranchoinc.com/store/el-rancho-supermercado/products/34704628-el-rancho-red-fajita-seasoning-27-oz" target="_blank"> (click link to order)</a></li>
            <li>2 limes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the skirt steak and with a sharp knife remove any excess fat around the meat</li>
            <li>Take the cilantro bundle and twist off the bottom half of the bundle discarding the stems and keeping just the leaves</li>
            <li>Roughly chop the cilantro leaves</li>
            <li>In a large bowl pour the 4 cups of olive oil</li>
            <li>Dip the skirt steak in the olive oil, let the excess oil drip into the bowl, move the skirt steak to a cutting board, and lay it flat</li>
            <li>Take the El Rancho seasoning and cover the meat generously. Flip the steak and finish covering</li>
            <li>Repeats steps 5 and 6 until all of the steak has been dipped in oil and covered in seasoning</li>
            <li>Pour all of the cilantro into the bowl of olive oil and stir</li>
            <li>Take all of the seasoned meat drop into the bowl</li>
            <li>Cut the 2 limes in half and squeeze <strong>1 1/2</strong> limes into the bowl (save remaining half for tacos)</li>
            <li>Thoroughly mix everything in bowl for 30 seconds </li>
            <li>Cover bowl in foil and stick in fridge for <em>at least</em> 2 hours (longer the better, overnight is the best)</li>

        </ol>
